 * Suppose the following array has been declared:

 * What indexes will be examined as the middle element by a binary search for each
 * of the following target values?
 * a. 65 Answer: 7, 11, 9, 8 return index 8 value 65
 * b. 9 Answer: 7, 3, 1, 2, 3 return -4

/* pg. 888 exercise 4
 * To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong? Consider N to be the
 * length or size of the array or collection passed to the method. Explain your reasoning.
 * 
 * public static int[] mystery1(int[] list){
 *     int[] result = new int[2 * list.length];
 *     for(int i = 0; i < list.length; i++){
 *         result[2 * i] = list[i] / 2 + list[i] % 2;
 *         result[2 * i + 1] = list[i] / 2;
 *     }
 *     return result;
 * }
 * 
 * Answer: The complexity class is O(N). The single loop N with a body containing 2(K) simple 
 * statements with 2(K) simple statements outside the loop. A loop with a body that contains K 
 * simple statements and that repeats N times will have a runtime of roughly (K * N). The simple 
 * statements include new array initializing with the elements of the new array are initialized 
 * to a default initial value and the other statements are variable assignments.

/* The following class is a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the 
 * largest element each time and moves it to the end of the array, rather than selecting the 
 * smallest element and moving it to the beginning.
 * Will this sort be faster than the standard selection sort, and what will the complexity class
 * (big-Oh) be? The complexity class of the modified version would O(N^2), which isn't any faster
 * than the standard. */

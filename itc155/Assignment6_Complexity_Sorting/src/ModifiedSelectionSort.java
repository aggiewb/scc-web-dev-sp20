 * Suppose the following array has been declared:
 * index            0  1  2  3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14
 * int[] numbers = {0, 0, 5, 10, 15, 40, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 300}; 
 * What indexes will be examined as the middle element by a binary search for each
 * of the following target values?
 * a. 65 Answer: 7, 11, 9, 8 return index 8 value 65
 * b. 9 Answer: 7, 3, 1, 2, 3 return -4
 * c. 90 Answer: 7, 11, 13, 12 return index 12 value 90
 * d. 147 Answer: 7, 11, 13, 14 return -15

/* pg. 888 exercise 4
 * To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong? Consider N to be the
 * length or size of the array or collection passed to the method. Explain your reasoning.
 * 
 * public static int[] mystery1(int[] list){
 *     int[] result = new int[2 * list.length];
 *     for(int i = 0; i < list.length; i++){
 *         result[2 * i] = list[i] / 2 + list[i] % 2;
 *         result[2 * i + 1] = list[i] / 2;
 *     }
 *     return result;
 * }
 * 
 * Answer: O(2N + 2) The single loop N with a body containing 2(K) simple statements with 2(K) simple 
 * statements outside the loop. A loop with a body that contains K simple statements and that 
 * repeats N times will have a runtime of roughly (K * N).

/* The following class is a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the

 * Will this sort be faster than the standard selection sort, and what will the complexity class
 * (big-Oh) be? */
